Task explanation taken from [here](https://github.com/rustam-azimov/ml-course/blob/main/tasks/task02_classification.md).

* **Deadline**: 23.11.2022, 23:59
* **Basic full score**: 5
* **Max points**: 9

## A task

- [x] Independently implement one of the classification methods, with the ability to adjust hyperparameters.
- [x] Take data to predict heart disease [here](https://github.com/rustam-azimov/ml-course/tree/main/data/heart_disease) (target feature for prediction --- **target** ). A demo notebook with the analysis of this data can be found [here](https://github.com/rustam-azimov/ml-course/blob/main/practice/practice07_knn_nb/practice07_part02_classification_heart_disease_demo.ipynb).
- [x] Read data, perform initial data analysis, if necessary, clean the data (**Data Cleaning**).
- [x] Perform exploratory analysis (**EDA**), use visualization, draw conclusions that may be useful in further solving the classification problem.
- [x] If necessary, perform useful data transformations (for example, transform categorical features into quantitative ones), remove unnecessary features, create new ones (**Feature Engineering**).
- [x] Using **hyperparameter matching**, **cross-validation** and, if necessary, **data scaling**, achieve the best prediction quality from your implementation on a preselected test set.
- [x] Repeat the previous point for library implementations (e.g. from **sklearn**) of all passed classification methods (**logistic regression, svm, knn, naive bayes, decision tree**).
- [x] Compare all trained models, build their **confusion matrices**. Draw conclusions about the models obtained in the framework of solving the classification problem on the selected data.
- [x] * (**+2 points**) Implement one more of the classification methods and add it to the comparison.
- [x] * (**+2 points**) Find data on which it will be interesting to solve the classification problem. Repeat all the tasks on the new data.
